# DAP-PROJECT
#In this project, three large datasets related to the code enforcement effort of a metropolitan area are utilized: violations, cases, and inspections. They are initially loaded into and indexed within a MongoDB database. Then, the data is transferred and transformed using dagster into its destination and final structure, a PostgreSQL environment. Finally, it is visualized using plotly, which shows in a concise and easily interpreted way the relationship between the different factors considered, which potentially allows for the identification of areas in which the current enforcement effort is less effective.
